            <p class="me" >Paul Gabriellini was born on June 12, 1991 from Long Island, New York. He made his theatrical debut in 2007 in The Crucible. Since then he has graduated from Buffalo State College in 2013 with a B.A. in Theater. He has performed in a number of varying and wide range roles in such performances as Anything Goes (Whitney), Seven Keys to Baldpate (Max), Fuddy Meers (Richard), Julius Caesar (Antony), The Stepmother (Peter), Dames at Sea (Lucky), and several short and independent films including It Happens Fast. Paul has extensive experience in improvisation having performed in and coordinated Friday Night Live, a weekly 90 minute improvisation show hosted by Students of Buffalo State College Theater Department for three and a half years and then moving on to form Pity Applause, an improvisation based show that mixes pre-recorded film segments with live performance to create an immersive narrative experience. As a Co-producer and core performer of the show, Pity Applause has enjoyed a successful run for the past 3 years in the highly competitive Manhattan Area. Paul has also taught basic improvisation to the children of Making Fishers of Men and Women after school program and continues to teach improvisation techniques to students of all ages and experience. Paul has a great understanding in immersive theater, having designed and directed two annual haunted houses for the organization of Making Fishers and community, winning several awards and recognition's for introducing theater to Buffalo communities including Volunteer and Service Learning Center's Outstanding Community Service Work Study Student which is supported by The Research Foundation of S.U.N.Y. His work was then applied in working several years for Nyctophobia, a Long Island regional yet highly successful Haunted House turned promenade and immersive theater experience which earned great acclaim from several reviewers including the Huffington Post. With a self-taught understanding and passion for film and film history, Paul has been a member of the entertainment media channel Pretty Much It  in charge of the classic movie recommendations segment.  Although learned in several areas of performance, Paul's drive lies in his passion for cinema and continues to pursue a career in film acting.</p>

                        <p>Pity Applause LIVE is a fast growing short form improvisation/variety show currently performing bi-weekly on Friday nights. Paul started this troupe, alongside his partner Eric Striffler Decemeber of 2013 strictly as an improv show but has developed into performances that consistently include live bands to open and written and planned material of any kind. Paul contributions to the shows are that of a producer, director, host, writer and performer of every show and although the workload is heavy he feels nothing but pride in having created something such as this show, out of nothing..</p>

The audience sat on the grass and watched directed/writer Gabriella Moreno's second Anne Frank Project. We each in the cast once again play human embodiments of emotions to showcase the extremes of emotion that one feels in times of despair.
